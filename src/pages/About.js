          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>Im Sebastian Ponce and I am a Web Developer in training. Im am still learning and trying out many things and it could it overwhelming at times, however I continue to try my best to imporve and learn as much as I can while still having a good time. I enjoy both front and back end, I do typically have a hard time with JavaScript but I learn from my mistakes. Over the last 12 weeks I have seen how far I have come and I am proud on how much I have learned during that time.</p>
          <br></br>
          <p>A little but about myself, I enjoy doing what most people do such as playing video games, drawing, sports, ect. Ive got a cat and dog that I can talk about for as long as you need me to with pictures/videos included. I was born and raised in Oregon, but I moved up to Washington State about 2 years ago and Ive had fun with these new experiences.</p>
